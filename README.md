# Voron Legacy Mini

![Render of the Printer](https://i.imgur.com/QYSxv2Z.png)

## What´s this?

Its a Voron Legacy, but smaller(and cuter). Its also enclosed and has an activated charcoal filter so i can print ABS without the nasty smell. Its the poor man´s version of the [Voron 0](https://vorondesign.com/voron0).

## Why?
Why not?

## What toolheads can i use with this adorable cute little machine?
Every toolhead thats Voron-compatible should theorically work here since it uses the same mount system as the Legacy.  Depending on the size of the toolhead, you may lose some print area.
I have personally tested the [Dragonburner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner)(recommended), [StealthBurner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner) and [AfterBurner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner) those allow you to use the full 120x120 area.

## Cool... can i build one?
NOT YET. This is still a work in progress. I still need to fit all the electronics somewhere, design the ducts for the auxiliary cooling fan, and address a few other details. Feel free to download the CAD files and take a peek if you’d like!
